# To Do List
This To-Do list is a full-stack implementation of all the knowledge we have
gained in the first four weeks of in-class work done at Prime.  With this list,
the user is able to add to-do items, mark them as complete, and delete them.
It is pretty much the coolest to-do list I've ever made.
